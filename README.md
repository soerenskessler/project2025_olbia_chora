Development of the Chora of Olbia Pontike


In the 5th century B.C., the Chora of Olbia Pontike in modern day Ukraine underwent some immense changes: At 500 B.C., more than 100 agricultural settlements existed at the Bug liman. Until 470, most of them had been abandoned with only 12 remaining in the direct environment of Olbia. In the early 4th century, many new settlements have been founded.
To explain these developments, there are mainly 3 theories:

1. There was an enormous construction boom in Olbia, drawing a lot of manpower of the Chora into the city.
2. The Scythes became a military threat to the colonising Greeks, forcing them into the fortified city.
3. The foundation of that many agricultural settlements created an economic bubble by providing an abundance of wheat and therefore reducing the global wheat prices in the Greek world. This led to the abandoning of many settlements.

As the archaeological evidence is insufficient and doesn’t provide a clear answer, these theories shall be tested via agent based modelling.
